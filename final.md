### Information Problem:

When scheduling classes, an information problem that UMD students come across is the inconvenience of having multiple laggy tabs open and forgetting which ones were actually needed. Since many students highly contemplate which courses to take and which instructors to take it with, the information problem we tried to resolve was this inconvenience, combining common information that students look into before scheduling all on one site. As course registration occurs at a time in which everyone is worried about their exams and projects, our aim was to alleviate some of the stresses during this time by making a website to make their decision making easier and more convenient. Stakeholders of this website would include current and prospective students from the University of Maryland. 

### Data Worked With:

**Links to API's**

- https://api.planetterp.com/#planetterp-api
- https://umd.io/

Our final project consists of two APIs. One from PlanetTerp and the other is umd.io which consists of an open-source API using UMD data. These two data sets are essential for solving our information problem which is helping students register for classes. These two APIs contain information regarding UMD courses, sections, grade distribution, student reviews, and much more that can all be used to help students determine if a certain course/professor is the right fit for them. The goal is to pull the data from both our APIs and combine them into a webpage and minimize the amount of tabs/work students need to do in order to find information regarding the course and professor they are trying to schedule.

              <p>The purpose of our project is to aid students on deciding on what courses to take, and with who. 
              Often not a lot of students have a difficult time deciding on what course to take. Factors such 
              as average grades received in the class, amount of homework given level of difficulty, along with 
              comments for each professor is beneficial when selecting what courses to take. Our goal is to 
              combine all these factors into one platform, making it easier for students to decide on how they
              want to be taught. We want to have these statistics (grade average, rating of the courses, 
              level of difficulty, etc.) all posted next to the specified course and professor. This way 
              students know what they’re getting themselves into, without needing to worry about the professor
              over assigning work or explaining work poorly.</p>
